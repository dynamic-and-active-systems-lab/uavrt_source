# ROS 2 Installation Notes 

ROS 2 is currently supported by on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu and REHL), and macOS (Mojave (10.14)). 
However, all testing thus far has been on Ubuntu. We are currently unsure as to whether the 
first version of UAVRT will be supported on any system other than Linux running Ubuntu. 
As such, the current and published installation notes will contain only the instructions for 
installing on Ubuntu 20.04. The installation notes that are related to all other systems 
will be located here as a reference. 

### Unsupported platforms

- Linux - REHL (which version? 8? amd64 and arm64?)
- macOS - Mojave (10.14)

### Dependencies

Installation instructions will be supplied for macOS Mojave (10.14).

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) will be used for installation purposes on macOS
